Hackathon Code of Conduct
=========================

> *TL;DR.* Be respectful. Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that
makes you uncomfortable at a CodeWorks Event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or
inappropriate environment, please report it using the procedures included in this document.
CodeWorks firmly stands for inclusivity. Every single person has the right to work in a safe and welcoming environment.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to
gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
social class, economic status, veteran status. Additional cases of harassment include but
not limited to sharing sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, brigading,
doxxing, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is
making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to
stop doing it.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, CodeWorks staff, and anyone else participating
in the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, attendees should
not use sexualised images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the
event. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised
clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, CodeWorks may take any action it deems
appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility
for reimbursement or refund of any type.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other
concerns, please contact CodeWorks using the reporting procedures defined below.
CodeWorks representatives can help participants contact security or local law
enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel
safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions in
relation to the event, hackathon-related social events.
